<h1>Borussia Dortmund</h1>

<p><i>Dortmund was founded in 1909, by a group of eighteen youths unhappy with the local chaplain's treatment of their church-sponsored football team. Being a relatively small club, Dortmund's ambitions were moderate to start with. The club barely avoided bankruptcy in 1929, and being an anti-Nazi oriented club during the Third Reich regime certainly didn't help matters. Their first taste of silverware came in the mid-50s, with two consecutive national titles in 1956 and 1957.</p></i>

<p><i>Despite the club’s success during the 1950s and 60s, the 1970s featured more adversity for the Black and Yellow. Financial problems accompanied by relegation from the Bundesliga in 1972 raised serious concerns about Dortmund’s future. Despite these concerns, construction of Dortmund’s iconic Westfalenstadion concluded in 1974. Currently named Signal Iduna Park for sponsorship purposes, Westfalenstadion has remained Dortmund’s home since 1974. The iconic Yellow Wall, the stadium’s south terrace, is the largest standing terrace in Europe and houses arguably the most passionate and dedicated section of football fans on the planet.</p></i>

<p><i>After Dortmund became the only German football club to enter the stock market at the turn of the millennium, their shares had started falling and the club found itself deeply in debt. The Bundesliga title in 2002 was not enough to turn the tide, and the club had to resort to selling their best players in order to survive. As a result of a sponsorship deal with an insurance company, Westfalenstadion would in 2005 change name to Signal Iduna Park for a limited time (until 2021). After a couple of miserable seasons, Jürgen Klopp's arrival in 2008 would set them back on the road to greatness. Under his leadership, Dortmund would prove to be the only true challenger to Bayern; their reignited rivalry was the main talking point of German football in the years that followed. During Klopp's seven years at the helm, Dortmund claimed two more Bundesliga titles (2011 and 2012) and their third DFB-Pokal (2012), but lost to Bayern in the 2013 Champions League final.</p></i>

<p2><b>Klopp’s remarkable tenure came to a halt when he stepped down in April of 2015. Without Klopp, Dortmund struggled both domestically and in European play. Staying true to their traditions, however, Dortmund found a way to overcome adversity in the 2018-19 season under Lucien Favre. Dortmund looked poised to retake the crown, but a late-season collapse left Dortmund settling for second.</p2></b>
